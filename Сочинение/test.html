	<p>When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side (setting it to 0 in this case); the second value affects the left and right side. (Here, auto is a special value that divides the available horizontal space evenly between left and right). You can also use one, three, or four values, as documented in Margin Syntax.</p>
